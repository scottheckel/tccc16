Twin Cities Code Camp 16 - Progressive Enhancement - Backbone Demo
======

This is a quick and dirty (emphasis dirty) ASP.NET/Backbone website to show off how one might initialize a BackboneJS Single Page app with content that is rendered on the server.  Key files to look at are...

TodoProgressive\css\style.css - End styling is for progressive enhancement of columns and other flair
TodoProgressive\js\main.js - Simple backbone Model/View that is hydrated with content from the HTML
TodoProgressive\Views\Todo\index.cshtml - Main Razor view
